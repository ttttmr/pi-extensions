## Features

### Time Periods

| Period | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Today** | From midnight (00:00) today |
| **This Week** | From Monday 00:00 of the current week |
| **Last Week** | Previous week (Monday 00:00 → this Monday 00:00) |
| **All Time** | All recorded sessions |

Use `Tab` or `←`/`→` to switch between periods.

### Timezone

Time periods are calculated in the local timezone where Pi runs. If you want to override it, set the `TZ` environment variable (IANA timezone, e.g. `TZ=UTC` or `TZ=America/New_York`) before launching Pi.

### Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Provider / Model** | Provider name, expandable to show models |
| **Sessions** | Number of unique sessions |
| **Msgs** | Number of assistant messages |
| **Cost** | Total cost in USD (from API response) |
| **Tokens** | Total tokens (input + output) |
| **↑In** | Input tokens *(dimmed)* |
| **↓Out** | Output tokens *(dimmed)* |
| **Cache** | Cache read + write tokens *(dimmed)* |

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `←` `→` | Switch time period |
| `↑` `↓` | Select provider |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Expand/collapse provider to show models |
| `q` / `Esc` | Close |

## Provider Notes

### Cost Tracking

Cost data comes directly from the API response (`usage.cost.total`). Accuracy depends on the provider reporting costs.

### Cache Tokens

Cache token support varies by provider:

| Provider | Cache Read | Cache Write |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Anthropic | ✓ | ✓ |
| Google | ✓ | ✗ |
| OpenAI Codex | ✓ | ✗ |

The "Cache" column combines both read and write tokens.

## Data Source

Statistics are parsed from session files in `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`. Each session is a JSONL file containing message entries with usage data. Assistant messages duplicated across branched session files are deduplicated by timestamp + total tokens (matching ccusage).

Respects the `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` environment variable if set.
